## And some DP implementation

When I read some book for learning programming I almost always rewrite the code by myself.
After that, I try to change something and see what will be happening. Sometimes I write some note from the book in the comment.
So it is my working place where I try to learn java more deeply using a great book "Effective Java"  by Joshua Bloch.

“Josh Bloch gives great insight into best practices that really can only be discovered
after years of study and experience.”

Also sometimes I learn some design patterns and write it here too.
